netifaces :

It’s been annoying me for some time that there’s no easy way to get the address(es) of the machine’s network interfaces from Python.

pip3 install netifaces 



=>see the list of interface identifiers for your machine. 

>>> import netifaces
>>> netifaces.interfaces()
['lo', 'eth0']


=>You can ask for the addresses of a particular interface by doing

>>> netifaces.ifaddresses('eth0')
{17: [{'addr': '06:f1:77:a1:cf:40', 'broadcast': 'ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff'}], 2: [{'addr': '172.31.21.154', 'netmask': '255.255.240.0', 'broadcast': '172.31.31.255'}], 10: [{'addr': 'fe80::4f1:77ff:fea1:cf40%eth0', 'netmask': 'ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff::/64'}]}


=>the hardware address of the Ethernet adapter running this interface. We can do


>>> addrs = netifaces.ifaddresses('eth0')
>>> addrs[netifaces.AF_LINK]
[{'addr': '06:f1:77:a1:cf:40', 'broadcast': 'ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff'}]


No, that isn’t an exceptionally long Ethernet MAC address—it’s a FireWire address.


=>As of version 0.10.0, you can also obtain a list of gateways on your machine:

>>> netifaces.gateways()
{'default': {2: ('172.31.16.1', 'eth0')}, 2: [('172.31.16.1', 'eth0', True)]}


Notice that here we have two separate gateways for IPv4 (AF_INET); some operating systems support configurations like this and can either route packets based on their source, or based on administratively configured routing tables.

=>
For convenience, we also allow you to index the dictionary with the special value 'default', which returns a dictionary mapping address families to the default gateway in each case. Thus you can get the default IPv4 gateway with


>>> gws = netifaces.gateways()
>>> gws['default'][netifaces.AF_INET]
('172.31.16.1', 'eth0')
