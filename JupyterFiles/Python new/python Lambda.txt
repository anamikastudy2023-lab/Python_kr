Python lambda :

In Python, anonymous function means that a function is without a name. 
As we already know that def keyword is used to define the normal functions
and the lambda keyword is used to create anonymous functions

Lambda definition does not include a return statement, it always 
contains an expression which is returned. We can also put a lambda 
definition anywhere a function is expected, and we don’t have to assign 
it to a variable at all. 


lambda arguments: expression

1.This function can have any number of arguments but only one expression, 
which is evaluated and returned.
2.One is free to use lambda functions wherever function objects are required.
3.You need to keep in your knowledge that lambda functions are syntactically restricted to a single expression.
4.It has various uses in particular fields of programming besides other 
types of expressions in functions.


def cube(y): 
    return y*y*y; 
  
g = lambda x: x*x*x 
print(g(7)) 
  
print(cube(5)) 

The filter() function in Python takes in a function and a list as arguments.

my_list = [1, 5, 4, 6, 8, 11, 3, 12]


new_list = list(filter(lambda x: (x%2 == 0) , my_list))


# Output: [4, 6, 8, 12]

print(new_list)


Example use with map() :

The map() function in Python takes in a function and a list.

The function is called with all the items in the list and a new list is 
returned which contains items returned by that function for each item

my_list = [1, 5, 4, 6, 8, 11, 3, 12]


new_list = list(map(lambda x: x * 2 , my_list))


# Output: [2, 10, 8, 12, 16, 22, 6, 24]

print(new_list)
